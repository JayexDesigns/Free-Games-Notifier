# Free Games Notifier
An app I made for windows to get notified when there is a new free game available

# User Use
For a normal user use you only have to execute the main.exe file and it will appear an interface showing the start button, the last 5 free games available, a button to show all the games and an update button. The startup checkbox has no use for now as it's a work in progress functionality.

# For Developers
To anyone who wants to see the code I have to warn you that I'm king of new at all this so my code is not messy but the structure of the app it is so I would apreciate a lot to get some feedback and know how can I improve it.
